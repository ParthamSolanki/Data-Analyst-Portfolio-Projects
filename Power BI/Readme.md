# Power BI project
Going to make a simple dashboard using power bi, going to take the data from the excel project as it is already more or less cleaned and there is not meant to be a lot of cleaning and data transforming to be done in power query as it is not as capable as the other tools that are specifically for data manipulation. Thinking about making similar dashboard to the one that was made in excel.
